Well, well, well
It seems like it was only yesterday
When my momma told me, "Don't fall in love
With the first girl that comes your way"
She was pretty and nice but I took her advice and passed her by
Years have passed and it don't look like
Loves gonna give me a second try

Boy, the look on your face tells me you understand
Could it be your love life, like mine needs a helping hand

Yeah you need love like I do, don't you?
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you
Know you girls

I know it ain't fit and proper for a girl to talk this way
But I can't cope with this loneliness, not one more dog-gone day
Every day has been an uphill climb to keeping my hopes afloat
Judging by your silence boy, you must be in the same boat
And again now

You need love like I do, don't you?
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you
Well, well, well, well,
You need love like I do, don't you?
It seems like I'm looking in the mirror, when I'm looking at you

I can't begin to tell how many night times have been all lonely
Come on, tell me girl does it ever happen to you?
I'm gonna tell you something and believe me it ain't no joke
My love life is just like a sinking boat

I can understand a person being without money
But surely there isn't a reason for a person to be without love
Listen to me now, I'm a girl and you're a guy
Yes it's true, come on lets give love a try
Ha ha damn

You need love like I do, don't you?
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you

You find that true love is a dream that everyone wants to come true
Can't you see its up to us to make this dream come true?

Yeah, you need love like I do, don't you?
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you
Well, well, well
You need love like I do, don't you?
Well, it seems like I'm looking in the mirror, when I'm looking at you

Ain't it true, ain't it true, ain't it true, ain't it true, ain't it true
Yes, it's true, true, true, true

You need love like I do, don't you?
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you
You need love like I do, don't you?
Well, it seems like I'm looking in the mirror, when I'm looking at you

You need love like I do, don't you?
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you
You need love like I do, don't you?
Well It seems like I'm looking in the mirror, when I'm looking at you

Ain't it true girl, I'm in love, I'm in love
'Cause I need you, and I need you too
