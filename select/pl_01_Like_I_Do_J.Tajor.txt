That's a drop-top coupe
Said you wanna
drive it down real soon
I just wanna love you like I do
Cause I never had someone
like you
Ain't nobody got this love
Got me cuffed
Ain't nobody bae
All I need is love
I just wanna run away with you
I'm just hoping that
you see and you notice
Can't stop with the way
I been falling
Fall back cause I'll catch
when you falling
I just need to know your mine

Freaky girl under the sheets
But you love when things
start slowing down
