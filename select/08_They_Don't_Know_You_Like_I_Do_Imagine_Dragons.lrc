[00:24.01] He was never gonna make it
[00:27.37] Every pill he found, he'd take it
[00:30.51] Always on the edge of breakdowns
[00:33.43] But keeping it together somehow
[00:36.84] Just another cold November
[00:39.74] You called me, but I didn't answer
[00:43.31] I was so oblivious
[00:46.05] Now I'm asking for forgiveness
[01:01.05] 
[00:49.58] For every single time I failed you
[00:52.73] I'm feeling like it's me that killed you
[00:55.96] Remembering the time they jumped you
[00:59.05] And I was too scared to help you
[01:02.49] Looking back, I can't erase it
[01:05.33] I guess it's time to face it
[01:08.66] You never seem to know how to let it all go
[01:30.16] 
[01:18.08] Don't listen to a single word they say about you
[01:24.15] They don't know you like I do
[01:30.86] Don't listen to a single word they say about you
[01:36.90] They don't know you like I do
[01:51.40] 
[01:41.07] Everybody saw you smiling
[01:43.73] Yeah, you were always good at hiding
[01:47.20] You were always asking questions
[01:50.47] So you wouldn't draw attention
[01:53.65] Everyone who used you
[01:56.82] They never really knew you
[01:59.90] You're always showing up for everybody but yourself
[02:25.40] 
[02:06.05] See, I wish I could take it back
[02:09.31] Change the future and erase the past
[02:12.57] Grab the bullet out and put you back
[02:15.61] I promise that I'd save your life like you saved mine
[02:20.76] But now it's far too late for that
[02:23.98] And all I have is your story left to tell
[02:29.59] So let me tell it
[02:32.87] Let me tell
[02:38.37] 
[02:34.80] Don't listen to a single word they say about you
[02:41.03] They don't know you like I do
[02:47.71] Don't listen to a single word they say about you
[02:53.71] They don't know you like I do
